          <h2>Hi, I'm Alice!</h2>
          <p>I'm an "Associate UI/UX Design Engineer" on the design system team at PTC. My title's a bit of a mouthful, so I often say I'm a product designer who dabbles in code. <p>Before my current role, I was designing animated graphics at an agency. And before that role, I was an English major and Computer Science minor at Vanderbilt University. I fell in love with design through creating flyers, websites, and merchandise for student extracurriculars.</p></p>
          <p>When I'm not designing, I enjoy reading, drawing, and learning how to boulder. I love my electric guitar and Carly Rae Jepsen :)</p>
