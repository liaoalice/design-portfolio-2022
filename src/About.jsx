          <h2>Hi, I'm Alice!</h2>
          <p>I'm a product designer on the design systems team at 1Password.
          </p>
          <p>Prior to working in design, I studied English and Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. I fell in love with design through creating flyers, websites, and merch for student extracurriculars. My multidisciplinary background bolsters my work in the form of digital accessibility, collaboration with developers, and building custom Figma tooling.</p>
          <p>When I'm not designing, I'm bouldering, drawing, exploring museums, playing guitar, reading ecology articles in <i><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a></i>, and writing speculative fiction.</p>
          <p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:alice.g.liao@gmail.com">alice.g.liao@gmail.com</a>.</p>
